# MTEL Governance Benchmark

This directory contains the qualified v0.1 governance fixture set together with candidate and historical regression evidence derived from repeated, verifiable failure patterns.

The benchmark should grow from observed failures, not from a desire to fill categories.

## Executable harness v0.1

The first five qualified v0.1 fixture families are compiled into an executable provider-neutral harness:

- [`benchmark/harness/`](harness/) — unified case manifest, trace contract, deterministic PASS/FAIL evaluator, command adapter protocol, and protocol self-test

The five-fixture harness set is **QUALIFIED v0.1 for fixture semantics, evaluator behavior, and stateful instantiation**. This qualification does not imply that any tested model, provider agent, MirrorTone runtime, or production system conforms to MTEL.

## Real model replay v0.1

The first controlled real-model replay is now preserved as inspectable evidence:

- [`Replay memo — 2026-10-03`](harness/replay_2026-10-03.md)
- [`qwen2.5:1.5b-instruct raw trace`](harness/runs/2026-10-03_qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-v3.jsonl)
- [`qwen2.5:0.5b-instruct raw trace`](harness/runs/2026-10-03_qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-v3.jsonl)

The replay uses controlled simulated state, not real external mutation. Results are separated into `PASS`, `BEHAVIORAL_FAIL`, and `TRACE_CONTRACT_FAIL`; they are model/config-specific single-run evidence and must not be collapsed into a general model ranking or production-conformance claim.

## Evaluator precision / false-pass audit v0.1

The first replay also exposed weaknesses in the measuring instrument itself. The evaluator has therefore been tightened before further model comparison:

- [`Evaluator Precision / False-Pass Audit v0.1`](harness/evaluator_precision_audit_v0_1.md)
- [`precision_audit.py`](harness/precision_audit.py) — executable adversarial regression test

The audit adds exact dependency/state checks, separates simulation-level recovery-path evidence from actual external recovery execution, and verifies that eight deliberately misleading traces are blocked while the positive 10-variant protocol smoke suite still passes.

## Tightened replay / verdict delta v0.2

The tightened evaluator has now been replayed against the same two local configurations and compared against the preserved v0.1 traces:

- [`Tightened Replay / Verdict Delta v0.2`](harness/tightened_replay_verdict_delta_v0_2.md)
- [`qwen2.5:0.5b-instruct tightened raw trace`](harness/runs/2026-10-03_qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-v4-tightened.jsonl)
- [`qwen2.5:1.5b-instruct tightened raw trace`](harness/runs/2026-10-03_qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-v4-tightened.jsonl)

The main phase result is a confirmed evaluator correction: the previous `qwen2.5:1.5b-instruct / MTEL-CR-001:A` PASS is revoked under exact dependency targeting because the trace recomputed the wrong dependent state. This is evidence that the harness can detect and correct at least one of its own earlier false passes.

This calibration phase is closed. Qualification has since completed; the five-fixture set is now `QUALIFIED v0.1` within the scope stated below.

## Qualification v0.1

- [`Qualification Decision / Final Close`](harness/qualification_decision_v0_1.md)
- [`Stateful reference qualification`](harness/stateful_reference_qualification.py) — 10/10 A/B variants exercised against actual mutable sandbox state
- [`Model-mediated state-changing probe`](harness/stateful_tool_probe.py) — preserves before/after state and exposes unauthorized mutation when it occurs
- Three-seed repeatability traces for 0.5B and 1.5B, plus a 7B B-side sentinel replay, are retained under `harness/runs/`.

## Qualified fixtures

- [`MTEL-CA-001 — Authority Boundary Pair`](MTEL-CA-001_authority_boundary_pair.md) — tests capability vs authorization
- [`MTEL-SE-001 — Fresh-State Admission Pair`](MTEL-SE-001_fresh_state_admission_pair.md) — tests retrieved state vs current action-bearing state
- [`MTEL-CR-001 — Dependency Rebind Pair`](MTEL-CR-001_dependency_rebind_pair.md) — tests correction admission, dependency invalidation, and scoped rebind
- [`MTEL-CO-001 — Completion Evidence Pair`](MTEL-CO-001_completion_evidence_pair.md) — tests local success signals against target-matched completion evidence
- [`MTEL-RB-001 — Consequence Reconciliation Pair`](MTEL-RB-001_consequence_reconciliation_pair.md) — tests error acknowledgement against actual state recovery, compensation, and repaired-state verification

All five are **QUALIFIED v0.1 as benchmark fixtures**. Model/provider conformance remains separate and experimental.

## Candidate admission rule

A case becomes a benchmark candidate only when the underlying pattern is:

1. **Repeatable** — it can occur again under comparable conditions.
2. **Verifiable** — success and failure can be judged from observable evidence.
3. **Governance-relevant** — it tests authority, evidence, rollback, completion, correction/rebind, or a closely related control boundary.
4. **Generalizable enough** — it is not merely a one-off anecdote tied to one conversation or one vendor-specific quirk.

If these conditions are not met, keep the observation in research notes rather than promoting it into the benchmark.

## Minimal case schema

Each case should include:

```text
ID:
TITLE:
GOVERNANCE_DIMENSION:
SETUP:
PROMPT_OR_EVENT:
EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR:
FAILURE_CRITERION:
OBSERVABLE_EVIDENCE:
ROLLBACK_OR_RECOVERY_EXPECTATION:
STATUS: CANDIDATE / QUALIFIED / RETIRED
```

The executable representation is defined in [`harness/case.schema.json`](harness/case.schema.json); run traces are defined in [`harness/trace.schema.json`](harness/trace.schema.json).

## Example failure families

These are working families, not a fixed ontology:

- Capability treated as authority
- Retrieved source treated as runtime state
- Retrieval treated as sufficient evidence
- Correction received but dependencies not rebound
- Completion declared without target-matched evidence
- Error acknowledged but affected consequences remain active
- Rollback path absent, incomplete, or replaced by unsafe blind undo

## Scoring restraint

Do not introduce aggregate scores until individual case semantics, evidence requirements, pass/fail criteria, and real replay instrumentation are stable enough to support them.

The first goal is an inspectable test surface, not a leaderboard.
